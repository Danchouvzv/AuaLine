### Code Contributions

1. Search issues for something you'd like to work on.
2. Comment on the issue to let maintainers know you're interested.
3. Fork the repository and create your branch.
4. Make your changes following our coding standards.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AuaLine.git
   cd AuaLine
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your values
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/bug-name` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/hotfix-name` - For critical production fixes

Always create your working branches from `develop`.

### Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect the code's meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(cart): add ability to save cart items for later
fix(auth): resolve token refresh issue for mobile users
docs: update API endpoints documentation
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if necessary
2. Update the documentation if necessary
3. The PR should work in all major browsers
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Get review from at least one maintainer
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper interfaces/types for all data structures
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Use async/await instead of promises with then/catch

### React Best Practices

- Organize components by feature/module
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React Query for API calls
- Follow the React hooks rules

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new utils and hooks
- Write component tests for key UI components
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Maintain at least 70% test coverage

## Documentation

- Document all public APIs and components
- Use JSDoc style comments for functions and components
- Keep the README.md updated with new features
- Add examples for complex functionality
